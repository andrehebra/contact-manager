## Technologies Used
Linux: We set up our development environment on Linux servers, providing a robust and secure foundation for our application.
Apache: Apache served as our web server, handling requests and serving our PHP scripts and static assets. We configured Apache to work with our domain and set up virtual hosts for the development and production environments.
MySQL: MySQL was used to create and manage the application's database. We designed a schema that efficiently stores contact information and allows for quick retrieval and manipulation.
PHP: PHP was used to write the server-side logic of the application. This included handling login/signup, search, edit, and delete requests by interacting with the database.
