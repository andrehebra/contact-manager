# [City Folk](http://cityfolk.world) Contact Manager

## Overview

City Folk Contact Manager is a web-based application developed using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). The application allows users to store and manage their contacts.

## Features

- Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email address.
- Edit existing contacts.
- Delete contacts.
- Search contacts.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

## Technologies Used
- Linux: We set up our development environment on Linux servers, providing a robust and secure foundation for our application.
- Apache: Apache served as our web server, handling requests and serving our PHP scripts and static assets. We configured Apache to work with our domain and - set up virtual hosts for the development and production environments.
- MySQL: MySQL was used to create and manage the application's database. We designed a schema that efficiently stores contact information and allows for quick retrieval and manipulation.
- PHP: PHP was used to write the server-side logic of the application. This included handling login/signup, search, edit, and delete requests by interacting with the database.
